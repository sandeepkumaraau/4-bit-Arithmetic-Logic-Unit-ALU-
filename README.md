# 4-bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-
This project was completed for the Design of Digital Circuits course (Summer 2024). The primary goal was to design, implement, and simulate a simple n-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) from scratch using the Logisim software. An ALU is a combinational digital circuit that performs a range of arithmetic and logical operations.
